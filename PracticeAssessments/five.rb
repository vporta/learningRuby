# "b" occurs once at index 0

# Save the Prisoner!
#
# A jail has n prisoners, and each prisoner has a unique ID number, ranging
# from 1 to n. There are m sweets that must be distributed to the prisoners.
# The jailer decides the fairest way to do this is by sitting the prisoners
# down in a circle (ordered by ascending ID number), and then, starting with
# some random prisoner, distribute one candy at a time to each sequentially
# numbered prisoner until all candies are distributed. For example, if the
# jailer picks prisoner ID=2, then his distribution order would be
# (2,3,4,5,...,n-1,n,1,2,3,4,...) until all m sweets are distributed.
#
# But wait — there's a catch — the very last sweet is poisoned! Can you find and
# print the ID number of the last prisoner to receive a sweet so they can be warned?

# n => Number of Prisoners
# m => Number of Sweets

# Write a method, #build_power_plants, that will take in two arguments. The
# first of which is the number of cities that need to be powered. The cities
# are arranged in a line and are equidistant from eachother.
#   The second argument will be the range of each powerplant (the number of cities
# in each direction a plant can reach and power). So, a range of 1 means that each
# plant can only reach the cities on either side of it. A range of 0 means that the
# plants can only power the city they are built in.
#
#   Your function should dictate which cities' powerplants need to be built such
# that all of the cities have power, and the least number of cities have powerplants
# as possible.
#
#   Output an array of the cities, with 0 representing a city without a powerplant
# and 1 representing a city with one.
#
# For example:
# build_power_plants(3, 2) means that there are three cities, and each powerplant
# will have a range of two cities. Therefore your function should output the array
# [ 0, 1, 0 ]
